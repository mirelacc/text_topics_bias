# Day 2:

## Panel: Speech and Language Technologies for Media Processing
## Chair: Susanne Weber, BBC
## Speakers: Peggy van der Kreeft, Deutsche Welle - Matt Simpson, Ericsson - 
## Alexandra Birch, University of Edinburgh - Maarten Verwaest, Limecraft

The abundance of digital platforms makes information available in a great number of languages,
and the expectation of users to be able to consume media in their own language is growing. 
International broadcasters such as the BBC and Deutsche Welle increasingly reach out to their global audiences
in multiple languages. As a result, content creation, monitoring and content delivery are heavily dependent on
the availability of speech and language technologies such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Machine Translation.
In this panel we want to discuss the state of the art of available language technologies for media processing 
and look at the challenges for low resourced languages.

## Fraunhofer Audio Mining: Solution for Broadcast Archiving
## Speaker: Joachim Koehler, Fraunhofer

This presenation shows the productive Fraunhofer Audio Mining solution used by the largest German broadcaster, WDR,
to index and archive huge amounts of broadcast data. The presentation shows the technology based on Deep Neural 
Networks, trainings procedures using very large speech corpora and the final solution integrated in a productive 
broadcast environment. Further, the evaluation and the results of the usage of media experts are reported.

## How emotions drive customer relationships – a case study about personal banking in the US
## Speakers: Lana Novikova, Heartbeat & Odile Jagsch, Kantar TNS

In a partnered survey between Kantar TNS and Heartbeat AI Technologies (Canada) personal banking in the US 
was investigated to find out if and how emotions drive customer relationships with banks. Kantar TNS launched 
a survey to evaluate 5 US banks regarding their performance and the customers’ preference for a bank using TNS’ 
one number KPI – the TRI*M Index. HEARTBEAT used its emotion text analytics application to extract emotions from 
survey open-ends. Data showed that personal banking is far from being an unemotional affair, and that higher 
TRI*M ratings for banks correlate with Love, Joy and Trust, while lower performing ones - with Sadness, Anger 
and Fear. Emotion analytics is a new powerful tool to help CX experts understand the “why” behind customer loyalty.

## Capturing Mixed Feelings with Fine Grained Sentiment Analysis
## Speaker: Caroline Brun, Xerox Research Centre Europe

The World Wide Web has become a global forum where people share their feelings about almost everything.
Social media networks spread vast amounts of user-generated content, where millions of people's opinions are
openly accessible. This content is of great value to policy makers, social scientists, and businesses. 
Due to the sheer quantity of information and the diversity of comments, managing brand reputation and customer 
relations will increasingly rely on technology that can automatically and reliably detect not simply binary 
opinions, but also, more subtle, nuanced sentiments and mixed feelings. While most of the work in sentiment 
analysis has primarily focused on classifying the overall polarity of user-generated documents, opinions or 
sentiments are usually not one-dimensional but multi-dimensional. People often care differently about different 
characteristics and features of products and services. There is a real need for organizations to understand what 
these specific sentiments are so they can pinpoint and prioritize what to do e.g. change features, improve service
or communicate differently. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is precisely about mining text and summarizing 
the opinions expressed to ascertain the attitude of a speaker or writer toward specific entities (things) and 
their aspects. The Xerox Research Centre Europe is exploring this challenging topic using a combination of 
advanced natural language analysis with machine learning algorithms. We will briefly describe the topic, related 
challenges and share our work on multilingual ABSA, including our participation to the SemEval 2016 international 
Challenge in ABSA. We are currently looking to pilot the system with partners.

## CoderRank: Creating Gold Standards
## Speaker: Stuart Shulman, DiscoverText

DiscoverText helps collect and clean messy Twitter data streams. Basic measurement tools improve human and 
machine performance over time. Learn to reach and substantiate inferences using a theoretical and applied model 
informed by a decade of interdisciplinary, National Science Foundation-funded research into the text classification
problem. In particular, learn how to apply patented “CoderRank” methods when training crowd-sourced annotators to 
create gold standard training sets for machine-learning.

## Data Conversation, Reinventing the Analysis Interface
## Speaker: Christophe Bourguignat, Zelros

Chatbots and conversational interfaces are the new big thing : they are intuitive, natural, and can be quickly
deployed without downloading a new app. Use cases for enterprises are numerous : agenda management, customer 
support, ... During this talk, we will focus on one particular B2B application : how intelligent assistants can 
reinvent the way analysts and data scientists access and spread advanced data analytics across organizations. 
We will describe a few scenarios and technological challenges like NLP and NLU in this type of context
